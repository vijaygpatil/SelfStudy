    <div class="question">
        <strong>13.</strong> Very few exoplanets are both close enough to Earth and bright enough compared to their parent star to be directly imaged. Most of the time, exoplanet discovery occurs via indirect means of detection. Images 14 and 15 compare two of these means. (10 points total)
        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(a)</strong> What methods of detection are depicted in Images 14 and 15 respectively? [2 pts]</div>
        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(b)</strong> Which image corresponds to the most practical detection method of a planet orbiting closely around a low-mass star? Why? [2 pts]</div>
        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(c)</strong> Which image could have been produced by the TESS mission? Why? [2 pts]</div>
        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(d)</strong> What is the approximate orbital period of the planet depicted in Image 14? [2 pts]</div>
        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(e)</strong> If the planet depicted in Image 15 were to orbit at a significantly slower orbital period with all else about its orbit unchanged, how would the plot appear different, if at all? [2 pts]</div>

        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(a)</strong> Radial velocity and transit methods</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(b)</strong> Image 14; radial velocity measurements are more pronounced when planet:star mass ratio is greater, and close orbits are harder to detect transits</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(c)</strong> Image 15; TESS makes transit detections and it is a transit plot</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(d)</strong> 10 days (+/- 2 days)</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(e)</strong> The decrease in brightness at center epoch 95.1990 days would remain the same depth, but would persist for a longer period of time</div>

        <strong>14.</strong> Image 16 is a simplified and exaggerated depiction of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, with variables a, b, and T denoting three different orbital measurements. (10 points total)
        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(a)</strong> What value do each of these variables represent, and what unit measurement (e.g. mass, distance, time, angle, etc.) do they correspond to? [3 pts]</div>
        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(b)</strong> How would you expect T to change (increase/decrease/no change) if both a and b were increased, with all else remaining the same? [2 pts]</div>
        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(c)</strong> How would you expect a, b, and T to change (increase, decrease, no change) if the mass of the Sun were increased, with all else remaining the same? [3 pts]</div>
        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(d)</strong> What measurement (not depicted) represents the "oval-ness" of the orbit? Write an expression for this measurement in terms of only the provided values. [2 pts]</div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>15.</strong> One of the most important measurements to determine the habitability of a planet is its equilibrium temperature, or T_eq. (10 points total)
        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(a)</strong> What is a planet's equilibrium temperature, described in words? [2 pts]</div>
        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(b)</strong> Is the Earth in temperature equilibrium? Why or why not? [2 pts]</div>
        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(c)</strong> Why is equilibrium temperature maintenance essential for habitability? What happens if a planet is not able to establish temperature equilibrium? [2 pts]</div>
        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(d)</strong> Imagine an exoplanet observed with the naked eye through an extremely powerful telescope. How would we expect the equilibrium temperature of the planet to change if its parent star were to grow dimmer? What would happen to the radiative energy output of the planet in this case, and how would we need to alter our observations to accommodate this change? [4 pts]</div>

        <div class="answer-label">Answers:</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(a)</strong> T_eq is the average temperature of a planet at which the energy receives from its parent star is equal to the energy it emits</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(b)</strong> Yes, because the energy it receives from the Sun and the energy it emits are balanced to one another</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(c)</strong> It is essential to habitability because life as we know it requires a stable T_eq within a certain range to begin and evolve. If a planet does not remain at a roughly constant T_eq, it will eventually grow either too hot or too cold to support life</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(d)</strong> We would expect the equilibrium temperature of the planet to drop proportionally to the star's dimming. This would have the effect of shifting its radiation out of the visible-light range and into the infrared or radio, leading us to begin observing it with a telescope more sensitive to these wavelengths</div>
        <div class="explanation">Equilibrium temperature is crucial for maintaining stable conditions necessary for life as we know it.</div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>16.</strong> Image 17 depicts the atmospheric spectrum of one of the Solar System's inner planets. (10 points total)

        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(c)</strong> Observe the dips in the plot corresponding to the "CO‚ÇÇ" label. What causes these dips to appear, and what does their appearance and size tell us about the composition of the atmosphere of this planet? [4 pts]</div>

        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(a)</strong> Labels represent molecules in the planet's atmosphere, and tell us about their concentration relative to other molecules</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(b)</strong> Venus, because of the concentration of CO‚ÇÇ and H‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ (Mercury/Earth/Mars don't have such high atmospheric concentrations of these molecules)</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(c)</strong> They are formed by radiated light from Venus being blocked as it impacts the CO‚ÇÇ molecules in its atmosphere. The dips appear because light at specific wavelengths is blocked by CO‚ÇÇ, and the size of the dip is directly proportional to the concentration of CO‚ÇÇ, telling us that CO‚ÇÇ is highly abundant in this planet's atmosphere</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(d)</strong> All of the dips and ridges in the plot would disappear it it would become a uniform curve, most closely resembling the spectrum of Mercury</div>
