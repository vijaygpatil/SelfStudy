If the mass of the star is doubled then P will decrease (1pt) by a factor of 2^(1/2) (2pts).

        <div class="answer-label">Answer:</div>
        <div class="answer-part">The winds in the atmospheric vortices are not strong enough to pick up dust (i.e., the dark material in plumes and fans) and to prevent shear of the vertical column, which was not observed.</div>

        <strong>57.</strong> (6 points) Hansen et al. (1990) and Kirk et al.

For three decades, this was the leading hypothesis for the origin of Triton's plumes, as when Voyager 2 had observed Triton, the plumes were close to the subsolar latitude (i.e., the latitude where the sun appears directly overhead at that moment). Recently, however, Hofgartner et al. (2019) argue that this isn't necessarily the case.
        <br><br>The plot below shows how the daily-averaged solar flux varies with latitude for different subsolar latitudes. Using this plot and knowing that the two confirmed, active plumes on Triton were located at 49¬∞ S and 57¬∞ S, briefly explain why the plumes' locations aren't necessarily as supportive of the solar-driven hypothesis as previously thought.

        <div class="answer-label">Answer:</div>
        <div class="answer-part">The maximum average daily solar insolation can actually be a significant distance from the subsolar latitude. The two plumes were located near the subsolar latitude when Voyager 2 observed them, but given their location, the maximum average daily solar insolation would actually take place close to the South Pole, and we didn't see plumes there.</div>
        <div class="explanation">This challenges the solar-driven hypothesis by showing that peak solar heating doesn't necessarily occur at the subsolar latitude.</div>

        <strong>58.</strong> (4 points) Hofgartner et al. suggest that it is possible to determine which of the three remaining theories is the origin of Triton's plumes through remote sensing.
        <br><br>Suppose that in the future, a spacecraft visits Triton. It finds the following:
        <br>‚Ä¢ The distribution of active plumes is independent of seasons and the distribution of nitrogen ice
        <br>‚Ä¢ The fans and plumes are water-rich
        <br>‚Ä¢ The temperatures associated with plumes are above the boiling point of nitrogen on Triton
        <img src="../images/Study-guide-7/sectionC58.png" alt="Triton plume analysis data" class="question-image" />

        <p><strong>Our Solar System has small, rocky planets (e.g., Earth and Mercury) and large planets with thick, gaseous envelopes (e.g., Jupiter and Neptune), but nothing in between. Outside of our Solar System, however, we know that planets between the size of Earth and Neptune exist. What are these planets like, and how common are they?</strong></p>
        <p><em>Using the California-Kepler survey, Fulton et al. (2017) find that the radii of these types of planets has a bimodal distribution, leading to a "radius gap" (sometimes called a "radius valley").</em></p>
    </div>

        <div class="answer-label">Answer:</div>
        <div class="answer-part">Light from the parent star (e.g., UV, x-ray) hits the atmosphere of a planet, heating up the molecules in it and causing some of them to "escape", slowly stripping the planet of its atmosphere. For some planets, it will strip away essentially all of the atmosphere, leaving behind a rocky core. For other planets, which have slightly stronger gravities, it won't, and the extra gaseous layer (which is not very dense) will lead to a significant increase in the radius of the planet.</div>
        <div class="explanation">Photoevaporation creates a natural division between planets that can retain atmospheres and those that cannot.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>61.</strong> (6 points) Ginzburg et al. (2017) proposes an alternate mechanism for the radius gap based on the residual heat of the core of the young planet leading to atmospheric erosion (also known as "core-powered mass loss"). In order to determine which mechanism (photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss) contributes more, they suggested seeing how the radius gap varies with stellar type (i.e., seeing if having a hotter or cooler parent stars effects the radius gap). Theoretically, how would this help astronomers distinguish between the two?

        <div class="answer-label">Answer:</div>
        <div class="answer-part">Photoevaporation, which is powered by the high-energy radiation, should see a strong dependence on stellar types, given that different types of stars give off different proportions of their energy in high-energy radiation. On the other hand, core-powered atmospheric erosion should be the same as long as the bolometric insolation (i.e. planets' equilibrium temperature) is held constant.</div>

        <p><strong>Our Solar System's structure is also unique. All eight planets lie in roughly the same plane and move in the same direction as the spin of our Sun. Furthermore, the four rocky planets are close to the Sun, while the large, gaseous planets are all farther away. This "tidiness" led astronomers centuries ago to think that planets (and planetary systems) stayed roughly the same after the planets first formed.</strong></p>
        <p><em>Over the past few decades, astronomers have discovered systems that shatter these antiquated theories. Among these are systems that include large planets that orbit very, very close to their parent stars. K2-33b is such a planet.</em></p>

        <div class="answer-part">Light from the young protostar is absorbed by gas and dust in the envelope and disk around it. The light is then reemitted in the IR. The disk persists longer than the envelope. A system that is older would not have the envelope or disk and would not have the "bump" in the IR in the SED. Protostars with both an envelope and a disk will have larger "bumps" than those with only a disk.</div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>64.</strong> (6 points) Determining whether planets like K2-33b formed near their present position (in situ) or formed elsewhere and migrated to their present position is an open question. Conceptually speaking, planet migration mechanisms can be loosely classified into three categories:
        <br>‚Ä¢ interactions with the protoplanetary disk
        <br>‚Ä¢ interactions with a stellar companion and the planet
        <br>‚Ä¢ interactions between multiple planets in the system

        <div class="answer-label">Answer:</div>
        <div class="answer-part">K2-33b shows that it is *possible* for a large planet to be very close to its star at a very young age. Migration involving the protoplanetary disk occurs earlier/faster than migration involving a stellar companion or multiple planets. Based on this information, it probably formed in-situ or migrated inwards using a mechanism involving the protoplanetary disk. This does not mean that *all* planets like K2-33b went through this sort of formation.</div>

        <strong>65.</strong> (4 points) Studying exoplanets has yielded new insight into the formation and early evolution of our Solar System. The earliest investigators focused primarily on whether gravitational interactions within the Solar System could scatter or even eject objects, which would populate the Oort Cloud.
        <br><br>A planet ejecting an object results in the planet's orbit moving inwards slightly. From an energy conservation perspective, why is this the case? Of the eight planets in the Solar System, which would scatter or eject objects the most efficiently?

    <div class="answer" id="answer-65">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer:</div>
        <div class="answer-part">The planet gives kinetic energy (which is positive) to the object getting ejected. The total energy in the system has to stay constant, so the planet's gravitational potential energy becomes more negative, corresponding with an orbit that is closer to the Sun. More massive planets will not have to move as far inwards when the scatter objects (for a given mass of the object being scattered), so Jupiter would be the planet most efficient for this process.</div>

        <strong>66.</strong> (4 points) Planetary scientists have had difficulty explaining the formation of Neptune via the core accretion process at its current location. In 2005, a series of papers by Rodney Gomes, Hal Levison, Alessandro Morbidelli, and Kleomenis Tsiganis established the first version of the Nice model (named after the French city, where some of the original work was done). In what way(s) does the Nice model potentially address this issue?

    <div class="answer" id="answer-66">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer:</div>
        <div class="answer-part">In the Nice model, Neptune formed much closer to the Sun, where the surface density of the disk was higher. This means that Neptune would have had enough time to form. Then, it migrated outwards to its present location. In some versions, Neptune and Uranus even switch places after forming (i.e., Neptune formed closer to the Sun than Uranus, but due to planetary migration, they switched places).</div>
        <div class="explanation">The Nice model solves Neptune's formation problem by invoking planetary migration from a more favorable formation location.</div>
