        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(1)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-1">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: The Sun</div>
        <div class="explanation">The Sun is the star at the center of our Solar System. It provides light and heat to all the planets, including Earth.</div>
        <div class="student-friendly">
            <div class="student-friendly-label">üåü Student Tip</div>
            Remember: The Sun is just one of billions of stars in our galaxy, but it's the only one close enough to give us warmth and light!
        </div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>3.</strong> Which planet is closest to the Sun?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-3">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Mercury</div>
        <div class="explanation">Mercury is the smallest planet and the one closest to the Sun. It has extreme temperatures - very hot during the day and very cold at night because it has almost no atmosphere.</div>
        <button class="toggle-deep-dive-btn" onclick="toggleDeepDive(3)">Deep Dive</button>
        <div class="deep-dive" id="deep-dive-3">
            <div class="deep-dive-label">üî¨ Planetary Scientist Deep Dive</div>
            <div class="deep-dive-content">
                <h4>Mercury's Extreme Environment</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Day temperature:</strong> Up to 427¬∞C (800¬∞F) - hot enough to melt lead!</li>
                    <li><strong>Night temperature:</strong> Down to -173¬∞C (-280¬∞F) - colder than Antarctica</li>
                    <li><strong>One day on Mercury:</strong> Equals 59 Earth days</li>
                    <li><strong>One year on Mercury:</strong> Only 88 Earth days</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Why Such Extreme Temperatures?</h4>
                Mercury has almost no atmosphere to trap heat, so the side facing the Sun gets extremely hot while the side facing away gets extremely cold.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>4.</strong> Which planet is known as the "Red Planet"?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-4">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Mars</div>
        <div class="explanation">Mars appears red because its surface contains iron oxide (rust). This gives the planet its distinctive reddish color that we can see from Earth.</div>
        <div class="student-friendly">
            <div class="student-friendly-label">üåü Student Tip</div>
            Think of Mars as a giant rusty ball! The iron in its soil has oxidized (rusted) over millions of years, just like how metal rusts on Earth.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>5.</strong> What is the largest planet in our Solar System?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(5)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-5">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Jupiter</div>
        <div class="explanation">Jupiter is so large that all the other planets in our Solar System could fit inside it! It's a gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</div>
        <button class="toggle-deep-dive-btn" onclick="toggleDeepDive(5)">Deep Dive</button>
        <div class="deep-dive" id="deep-dive-5">
            <div class="deep-dive-label">üî¨ Planetary Scientist Deep Dive</div>
            <div class="deep-dive-content">
                <h4>Jupiter's Incredible Size</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mass:</strong> 2.5 times more massive than all other planets combined</li>
                    <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 11 times wider than Earth</li>
                    <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Could fit 1,321 Earths inside it</li>
                    <li><strong>Great Red Spot:</strong> A storm larger than Earth that has been raging for centuries</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Jupiter as a "Failed Star"</h4>
                Jupiter is sometimes called a "failed star" because it's made of the same materials as the Sun, but it didn't get big enough to start nuclear fusion.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>6.</strong> Which planet has the most visible rings?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(6)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-6">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Saturn</div>
        <div class="explanation">Saturn has the most spectacular and visible ring system. The rings are made of billions of pieces of ice and rock, ranging in size from tiny particles to house-sized chunks.</div>
        <div class="student-friendly">
            <div class="student-friendly-label">üåü Student Tip</div>
            Fun fact: Saturn's rings are so thin that if you made a scale model where the rings were as wide as a football field, they would only be as thick as a piece of paper!
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>7.</strong> What is the hottest planet in our Solar System?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(7)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-7">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Venus</div>
        <div class="explanation">Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus is actually hotter because of its thick atmosphere that traps heat like a greenhouse. Venus reaches temperatures of about 462¬∞C (864¬∞F).</div>
        <button class="toggle-deep-dive-btn" onclick="toggleDeepDive(7)">Deep Dive</button>
        <div class="deep-dive" id="deep-dive-7">
            <div class="deep-dive-label">üî¨ Planetary Scientist Deep Dive</div>
            <div class="deep-dive-content">
                <h4>Venus's Extreme Greenhouse Effect</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> 96% carbon dioxide, creating a super-strong greenhouse effect</li>
                    <li><strong>Pressure:</strong> 90 times stronger than Earth's - like being 1 km underwater</li>
                    <li><strong>Clouds:</strong> Made of sulfuric acid, not water</li>
                    <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Hot enough to melt lead, and stays the same day and night</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Why Venus is Hotter than Mercury</h4>
                Venus's thick atmosphere acts like a blanket, trapping heat from the Sun. Mercury has almost no atmosphere, so heat escapes easily.

    <div class="question">
        <strong>8.</strong> Which two planets are called "ice giants"?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(8)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-8">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Uranus and Neptune</div>
        <div class="explanation">Uranus and Neptune are called ice giants because they contain more water, methane, and ammonia ices in their interiors compared to Jupiter and Saturn, which are mostly hydrogen and helium.</div>
        <div class="student-friendly">
            <div class="student-friendly-label">üåü Student Tip</div>
            Think of it this way: Jupiter and Saturn are "gas giants" (mostly gas), while Uranus and Neptune are "ice giants" (more ice and rock inside).
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>9.</strong> What is the name of Earth's natural satellite?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(9)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-9">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: The Moon</div>
        <div class="explanation">The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It's about 1/4 the size of Earth and is responsible for our ocean tides.</div>
        <div class="student-friendly">
            <div class="student-friendly-label">üåü Student Tip</div>
            The Moon is moving away from Earth very slowly - about 3.8 cm (1.5 inches) per year. That's about as fast as your fingernails grow!
        </div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>10.</strong> Which planet spins on its side?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(10)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-10">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Uranus</div>
        <div class="explanation">Uranus rotates on its side, with its axis tilted about 98 degrees. This means its poles sometimes point directly at the Sun, giving it very unusual seasons.</div>
        <button class="toggle-deep-dive-btn" onclick="toggleDeepDive(10)">Deep Dive</button>
        <div class="deep-dive" id="deep-dive-10">
            <div class="deep-dive-label">üî¨ Planetary Scientist Deep Dive</div>
            <div class="deep-dive-content">
                <h4>Uranus's Unusual Rotation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tilt:</strong> 98 degrees (most planets tilt less than 30 degrees)</li>
                    <li><strong>Seasons:</strong> Each season lasts about 21 Earth years</li>
                    <li><strong>Day/Night:</strong> Each pole has 42 years of continuous daylight, then 42 years of darkness</li>
                    <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Scientists think a large object crashed into Uranus long ago, knocking it on its side</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>11.</strong> What is the asteroid belt?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(11)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-11">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: A region of space between Mars and Jupiter filled with rocky objects called asteroids</div>
        <div class="explanation">The asteroid belt contains thousands of rocky objects left over from when the Solar System formed. Most asteroids are much smaller than planets - some are as small as houses, others as large as mountains.</div>
        <div class="student-friendly">
            <div class="student-friendly-label">üåü Student Tip</div>
            Despite what movies show, the asteroid belt isn't crowded! The asteroids are spread out over such a huge area that spacecraft can easily fly through without hitting anything.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>12.</strong> What is a comet made of?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(12)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-12">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Ice, dust, and rock</div>
        <div class="explanation">Comets are often called "dirty snowballs" because they're made of frozen water, carbon dioxide, and other ices mixed with dust and rocky particles. When they get close to the Sun, the ice turns to gas and creates a glowing tail.</div>
        <div class="student-friendly">
            <div class="student-friendly-label">üåü Student Tip</div>
            A comet's tail always points away from the Sun, no matter which direction the comet is traveling. It's like the Sun is blowing the tail away with solar wind!
        </div>
    </div>

        <strong>13.</strong> Which planet has the Great Red Spot?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(13)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-13">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Jupiter</div>
        <div class="explanation">The Great Red Spot is a giant storm on Jupiter that has been raging for at least 400 years. It's so big that Earth could fit inside it!</div>
        <div class="student-friendly">
            <div class="student-friendly-label">üåü Student Tip</div>
            Imagine a hurricane that's been going for 400 years and is bigger than our entire planet - that's the Great Red Spot!

    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-14">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Earth's tilted axis</div>
        <div class="explanation">Earth is tilted about 23.5 degrees as it orbits the Sun. This tilt means different parts of Earth receive more or less direct sunlight during the year, creating our seasons.</div>

                <h4>How Earth's Tilt Creates Seasons</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Your hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, getting more direct sunlight</li>

    <div class="answer" id="answer-40">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Neptune</div>
        <div class="explanation">After Uranus (which is tilted 98 degrees), Neptune has the next most tilted axis at about 28 degrees. This gives Neptune more extreme seasons than most planets, but not as extreme as Uranus.</div>

            <div class="student-friendly-label">üåü Student Tip</div>
            Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees, so Neptune's 28-degree tilt would give it slightly more extreme seasons than Earth.

    <div class="answer" id="answer-94">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Organisms that can survive in extreme conditions</div>
        <div class="explanation">Extremophiles are living things that thrive in conditions that would kill most other life forms - like boiling water, freezing cold, high radiation, or very acidic environments. They show us that life can exist in more places than we thought possible.</div>
        <div class="student-friendly">

    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-95">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: The idea that life can spread from one planet to another through space</div>
        <div class="explanation">Panspermia suggests that microorganisms or the building blocks of life could travel between planets on meteorites or comets. This could mean life on Earth might have originally come from Mars, or that life from Earth could spread to other planets.</div>
        <div class="student-friendly">
            <div class="student-friendly-label">üåü Student Tip</div>

    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-96">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: A dwarf planet hasn't cleared its orbital neighborhood of other objects</div>
        <div class="explanation">To be a full planet, an object must: 1) orbit the Sun, 2) be round due to its own gravity, and 3) have cleared its orbital neighborhood. Dwarf planets like Pluto meet the first two criteria but not the third - they share their orbital space with lots of other objects.</div>
        <div class="student-friendly">
            <div class="student-friendly-label">üåü Student Tip</div>
            Think of it like this: planets are like bullies who have cleared everyone else out of their neighborhood, while dwarf planets are more friendly and share their space!

    <div class="answer" id="answer-97">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: A spherical shell of icy objects surrounding our Solar System</div>
        <div class="explanation">The Oort Cloud is a theoretical region far beyond Pluto where billions of icy objects orbit the Sun. Long-period comets (those that take hundreds or thousands of years to orbit) come from the Oort Cloud.</div>
        <div class="student-friendly">
            <div class="student-friendly-label">üåü Student Tip</div>
            The Oort Cloud is like a giant freezer surrounding our Solar System, storing icy objects that occasionally fall inward to become comets!

        <strong>99.</strong> What is the difference between mass and weight?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(99)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-99">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Mass is the amount of matter in an object; weight is the force of gravity acting on that mass</div>
        <div class="explanation">Your mass stays the same everywhere in the universe, but your weight changes depending on the gravity of the planet you're on. On the Moon, you'd weigh about 1/6 of what you weigh on Earth, but your mass would be the same.</div>
        <div class="student-friendly">
            <div class="student-friendly-label">üåü Student Tip</div>
            Mass is like how much "stuff" you're made of - that never changes. Weight is how hard gravity pulls on that stuff - that changes depending on where you are!
