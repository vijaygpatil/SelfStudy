    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Planet Formation</div>
        <strong>1.</strong> What is the core accretion model of planet formation?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(1)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-1">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: The core accretion model describes how planets form by first building a solid core through the accumulation of dust and ice, which then attracts gas to form an atmosphere</div>
        <div class="explanation">In this model, solid particles in the protoplanetary disk stick together to form larger and larger objects. Once a core reaches about 10 Earth masses, it can gravitationally attract gas from the surrounding nebula.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            The core accretion model explains why gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn have solid cores surrounded by thick atmospheres. The process is more efficient beyond the "frost line" where water can freeze, providing more solid material for core formation.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Planet Formation</div>
        <strong>2.</strong> How does the disk instability model differ from core accretion?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-2">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: The disk instability model proposes that gas giants form directly from gravitational collapse of dense regions in the protoplanetary disk, without first forming a solid core</div>
        <div class="explanation">This model suggests that massive planets can form much faster than core accretion allows, which helps explain the existence of very massive planets at large distances from their stars.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            Disk instability requires specific conditions: the disk must be massive enough and cool enough for gravitational instabilities to develop. This model may explain "super-Jupiters" found far from their host stars.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Solar System Objects</div>
        <strong>3.</strong> What makes Mercury's surface composition unique among terrestrial planets?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-3">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Mercury has an unusually large iron core (about 75% of its radius) and a very thin silicate mantle, making it the densest planet after Earth</div>
        <div class="explanation">Mercury's high density and large core suggest it either formed in a metal-rich region of the solar nebula or lost much of its original silicate mantle through a giant impact or intense solar heating.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            The BepiColombo mission (launched 2018) is studying Mercury's magnetic field, surface composition, and internal structure to better understand how such a metal-rich planet formed so close to the Sun.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Gas Giants</div>
        <strong>4.</strong> What is metallic hydrogen, and where is it found in Jupiter?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-4">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Metallic hydrogen is a phase of hydrogen that conducts electricity like a metal, formed under extreme pressure deep within Jupiter's interior</div>
        <div class="explanation">At pressures exceeding 1-4 million times Earth's atmospheric pressure, hydrogen molecules break apart and the electrons become mobile, creating a metallic state. This occurs in Jupiter's deep interior.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            The Juno mission has provided new insights into Jupiter's interior structure, suggesting the metallic hydrogen region may be less distinct than previously thought, with a more gradual transition from molecular to metallic hydrogen.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Ice Giants</div>
        <strong>5.</strong> Why are Uranus and Neptune called "ice giants" rather than "gas giants"?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(5)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-5">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Uranus and Neptune contain much higher proportions of water, methane, and ammonia "ices" in their interiors compared to Jupiter and Saturn, which are primarily hydrogen and helium</div>
        <div class="explanation">While Jupiter and Saturn are about 90% hydrogen and helium, Uranus and Neptune are only about 20% hydrogen and helium, with the rest being heavier elements and compounds that were "ices" in the cold outer solar system.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            The ice giants likely formed closer to the Sun and migrated outward, or formed from a different population of planetesimals with higher ice content. Their unusual magnetic fields suggest complex internal structures with convecting ionic fluids.

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Dwarf Planets</div>
        <strong>6.</strong> What are the three criteria that define a planet, and which one does Pluto fail to meet?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(6)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-6">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: The three criteria are: (1) orbits the Sun, (2) has sufficient mass for hydrostatic equilibrium (roughly round), (3) has cleared its orbital neighborhood. Pluto fails the third criterion</div>
        <div class="explanation">Pluto shares its orbital region with many other Kuiper Belt objects and has not gravitationally dominated its orbital zone, unlike the eight planets which have cleared their orbits of other objects.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            The "clearing the neighborhood" criterion is quantified by the planetary discriminant Œº = M¬≤/a¬≥, where M is the planet's mass and a is its orbital radius. Pluto's Œº is about 0.07, while the smallest planet (Mercury) has Œº = 91,000.

    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Small Bodies</div>
        <strong>7.</strong> What makes Ceres unique among asteroids?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(7)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-7">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt and the only dwarf planet located there, with evidence of water ice and possible subsurface briny water</div>
        <div class="explanation">Ceres comprises about one-third of the asteroid belt's total mass and shows signs of geological activity, including bright spots that may be salt deposits from subsurface brines.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            The Dawn mission revealed that Ceres has a differentiated interior with a rocky core and icy mantle. Bright spots in Occator crater are sodium carbonate deposits, suggesting recent geological activity and possible habitability.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Moons</div>
        <strong>8.</strong> What evidence suggests that Earth's Moon formed from a giant impact?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(8)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-8">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: The Moon's composition is similar to Earth's mantle, it has a small iron core relative to its size, and the Earth-Moon system has unusually high angular momentum</div>
        <div class="explanation">The giant impact hypothesis explains why the Moon lacks iron (it formed from mantle material), why Earth spins rapidly, and why the Moon is unusually large relative to Earth compared to other planet-moon systems.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            Isotopic analysis shows that Earth and Moon have nearly identical oxygen isotope ratios, suggesting they formed from the same material reservoir. Computer simulations indicate the impactor was about Mars-sized and struck Earth at an oblique angle.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Moons</div>
        <strong>9.</strong> Why is Triton's retrograde orbit evidence that it was captured?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(9)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-9">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Triton orbits Neptune backwards (retrograde) compared to Neptune's rotation, which is extremely unlikely for a moon that formed in place around the planet</div>
        <div class="explanation">Moons that form from the same disk as their planet should orbit in the same direction as the planet's rotation. Triton's retrograde orbit suggests it was a captured Kuiper Belt object, possibly similar to Pluto.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            Triton's capture likely disrupted Neptune's original moon system. The capture process would have circularized Triton's orbit through tidal heating, explaining its current geological activity including nitrogen geysers.

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Small Bodies</div>
        <strong>10.</strong> What makes 25143 Itokawa significant in asteroid science?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(10)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-10">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Itokawa was the first asteroid from which samples were successfully returned to Earth by the Hayabusa mission, revealing it to be a "rubble pile" asteroid</div>
        <div class="explanation">The Hayabusa mission showed that Itokawa is not a solid rock but rather a collection of boulders held together by weak gravity, with very low density and high porosity.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            Analysis of Itokawa samples revealed space weathering processes, solar wind implantation, and micrometeorite impacts. The asteroid's structure suggests it formed from the reaccumulation of fragments from a larger parent body that was disrupted by collision.

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Comets</div>
        <strong>11.</strong> What did the Deep Impact mission reveal about comet Tempel 1's interior?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(11)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-11">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: The Deep Impact mission showed that Tempel 1's interior is more porous and less icy than expected, with fine dust and organic compounds beneath the surface</div>
        <div class="explanation">When Deep Impact's impactor struck Tempel 1, it excavated fine powder rather than chunks of ice, suggesting the comet's interior is fluffy and dust-rich with ice mixed throughout rather than being a solid "dirty snowball."</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            The mission revealed that comets are more complex than simple mixtures of ice and dust. Tempel 1 showed evidence of layered structure, suggesting multiple formation episodes or evolutionary processes in the early solar system.

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Kuiper Belt Objects</div>
        <strong>12.</strong> What does Arrokoth's contact binary shape tell us about early solar system formation?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(12)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-12">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Arrokoth's gentle contact binary shape indicates it formed through low-velocity accretion, supporting models where planetesimals formed through gravitational collapse rather than violent collisions</div>
        <div class="explanation">The two lobes of Arrokoth came together at very low speed (about 2 m/s), preserving their original shapes. This suggests early planetesimal formation was a gentle process, not the violent collisional cascade once thought.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            Arrokoth's pristine condition and red color (from organic tholins) indicate it has remained largely unchanged since formation 4.6 billion years ago. Its formation supports the "streaming instability" model where particles clumped together gravitationally in the early solar nebula.

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Minimum Mass Solar Nebula</div>
        <strong>13.</strong> What is the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN) model?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(13)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-13">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: The MMSN is a theoretical model that calculates the minimum amount of material needed in the solar nebula to form the planets we observe today</div>
        <div class="explanation">The MMSN assumes that planets formed in place and calculates backward from current planetary masses and compositions to determine how much material must have been present in the original disk.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            The MMSN predicts surface density œÉ ‚àù r^(-3/2), where œÉ is surface density and r is distance from the Sun. However, this model has limitations as it doesn't account for planetary migration or the loss of material from the disk over time.

    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Planet Migration</div>
        <strong>14.</strong> How does Type I planetary migration work?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(14)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-14">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Type I migration occurs when a low-mass planet creates spiral density waves in the disk that exert torques on the planet, typically causing inward migration</div>
        <div class="explanation">Small planets (less than about 10 Earth masses) don't clear gaps in the disk but create spiral waves. The inner wave carries more angular momentum than the outer wave, resulting in a net inward torque on the planet.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            Type I migration can be very rapid, potentially causing planets to spiral into their stars in less than a million years. Various mechanisms like disk turbulence, magnetic fields, or compositional gradients may slow or reverse this migration.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Planet Migration</div>
        <strong>15.</strong> What is Type II planetary migration?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(15)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-15">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Type II migration occurs when a massive planet opens a gap in the disk and becomes locked to the disk's viscous evolution, migrating inward as the disk accretes onto the star</div>
        <div class="explanation">Planets more massive than about 10 Earth masses can clear gaps in the disk. The planet then migrates at the same rate as the disk material flows inward due to viscous processes.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            Type II migration is generally slower than Type I and depends on the disk's viscosity. The migration rate is typically ·πô = -3ŒΩ/(2r), where ŒΩ is the kinematic viscosity and r is the orbital radius.

    <div class="question">
        <div class="topic-label">Mass Loss</div>
        <strong>16.</strong> What processes cause planets to lose mass over time?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(16)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-16">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Planets can lose mass through atmospheric escape (thermal, hydrodynamic, or impact-driven), photoevaporation from stellar radiation, and tidal stripping by their host star</div>
        <div class="explanation">Young planets with extended atmospheres are particularly susceptible to mass loss. High-energy radiation from young stars can heat and strip away planetary atmospheres, especially for close-in planets.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            The mass loss rate depends on the planet's escape velocity, atmospheric composition, and stellar irradiation. The "evaporation valley" observed in exoplanet populations may result from atmospheric mass loss creating a gap between rocky super-Earths and gaseous mini-Neptunes.

        <strong>17.</strong> How do the internal structures of Mercury and Neptune differ?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(17)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-17">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Mercury has a large iron core (75% of radius) with a thin silicate mantle, while Neptune has a small rocky core surrounded by a mantle of water, methane, and ammonia ices, topped by a hydrogen-helium atmosphere</div>
        <div class="explanation">Mercury is the most metal-rich planet, while Neptune is dominated by "ices" (compounds that were frozen in the outer solar system). Their formation locations and processes were completely different.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            Mercury's large core may result from a giant impact that stripped away much of its silicate mantle, or from preferential condensation of metals close to the Sun. Neptune's structure reflects formation in the cold outer disk where ices could condense.

    <div class="answer" id="answer-40">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: The flux received by a planet decreases as 1/r¬≤, where r is the distance from the star: F = L_star/(4œÄr¬≤)</div>
        <div class="explanation">This law determines the habitable zone boundaries and planetary equilibrium temperatures. Planets twice as far from their star receive one-fourth the energy, making them much colder.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            The habitable zone scales as ‚àöL_star, so more luminous stars have habitable zones farther out. For main sequence stars, L ‚àù M‚Å¥, so massive stars have much larger habitable zones but shorter lifetimes.

    <div class="answer" id="answer-41">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Key challenges include power generation (RTGs needed beyond Jupiter), communication delays, thermal management, and long travel times requiring robust, autonomous systems</div>
        <div class="explanation">Solar panels become ineffective beyond Mars, requiring radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Communication with Earth takes hours, so spacecraft must operate autonomously. Extreme cold requires careful thermal design.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            Power decreases as 1/r¬≤ from the Sun, so Jupiter receives 1/25th Earth's solar flux. RTGs use Pu-238 decay heat converted to electricity via thermoelectric materials. Voyager RTGs still operate after 45+ years, though power output has declined significantly.

        <strong>42.</strong> How do gravity assists work and why are they important for space missions?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(42)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-42">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Gravity assists use a planet's orbital motion to accelerate or decelerate spacecraft, enabling missions to distant targets without carrying enormous amounts of fuel</div>
        <div class="explanation">As a spacecraft approaches a moving planet, it gains energy from the planet's orbital motion. The spacecraft's speed relative to the Sun can increase significantly, while the planet's orbit is barely affected due to its much larger mass.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            The velocity change depends on the spacecraft's approach geometry and the planet's orbital velocity. Voyager 2's Grand Tour used gravity assists from Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus to reach Neptune, a trajectory possible only every 175 years due to planetary alignment.

        <strong>43.</strong> What are the advantages of space-based telescopes over ground-based telescopes?
        <button class="toggle-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(43)">Show Answer</button>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="answer-43">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Space telescopes avoid atmospheric distortion, can observe all wavelengths of light, have no weather interference, and can observe continuously without day/night cycles</div>
        <div class="explanation">Earth's atmosphere blocks many wavelengths of light and causes turbulence that blurs images. Space telescopes like Hubble and JWST can achieve much sharper images and detect infrared and ultraviolet light that doesn't reach the ground.</div>
        <div class="advanced-explanation">
            <div class="advanced-label">üî¨ Advanced Concept</div>
            Atmospheric seeing limits ground-based telescopes to ~1 arcsecond resolution, while space telescopes achieve diffraction-limited performance. The atmosphere blocks UV, most IR, and all X-ray/gamma-ray wavelengths, making space observations essential for multi-wavelength astronomy.

        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Juno is using gravity measurements and microwave observations to map Jupiter's interior structure, revealing that the core is larger and more diffuse than expected</div>
        <div class="explanation">Juno's precise gravity measurements show that Jupiter's core is not a small, dense ball but rather a large, "fuzzy" or partially dissolved core that extends to about half of Jupiter's radius.</div>

    <div class="answer" id="answer-48">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: Voyager 2 used a rare planetary alignment called the "Grand Tour" that occurs every 175 years, using gravity assists from each planet to reach the next one</div>
        <div class="explanation">The mission launched in 1977 during a unique window when the outer planets were aligned in a way that allowed a single spacecraft to visit Jupiter (1979), Saturn (1981), Uranus (1986), and Neptune (1989).</div>
