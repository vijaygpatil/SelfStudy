        <div class="explanation">A false-color image is one where the colors shown are not the same as what the human eye would see. Scientists often take images in different wavelengths of light (like infrared, ultraviolet, or radio waves) that are invisible to humans, then assign visible colors to represent these wavelengths. This helps reveal features, temperatures, or compositions that wouldn't be visible in regular photographs. For example, a "red" area might actually represent hot temperatures detected in infrared light.</div>

        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(a)</strong> A tidal force is the difference in gravitational pull on different parts of an object, caused by the fact that gravity is stronger on the side closer to the source of gravity.</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(b)</strong> Spring tides have the highest high tides and the lowest low tides - the greatest difference between high and low tide levels.</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(c)</strong> The Sun, Moon, and Earth are aligned (either in a line during new moon or full moon)</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(d)</strong> Neap tides have the smallest difference between high and low tides - the high tides are lower and the low tides are higher than average.</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(e)</strong> The Sun and Moon are at right angles (90 degrees) to each other as seen from Earth (during first quarter or third quarter moon)</div>
