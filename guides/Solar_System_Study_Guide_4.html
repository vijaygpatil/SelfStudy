    <div class="question">
        <strong>2.</strong> You observe two transit detections corresponding to two planets transiting a given star. (Assume both planets transit across the center of the star, and that both planets are the same distance from the star, however unrealistic that may be.) The second transit has a dip in flux equal to four times the dip in flux from the first transit. What is the ratio of the radius of the first planet R‚ÇÅ to that of the second planet R‚ÇÇ? [1 point]

    <div class="answer" id="answer-22">
        <div class="answer-label">Answer: C - 2R‚ÇÅ = R‚ÇÇ</div>
        <div class="explanation">Transit depth is proportional to the square of the planet radius. If the second transit has 4√ó the depth, then R‚ÇÇ¬≤ = 4R‚ÇÅ¬≤, so R‚ÇÇ = 2R‚ÇÅ.</div>

        </div>

        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(a)</strong> Estimate the amount of time between the start of ingress and the end of egress, in days. Don't worry about the exact value, so long as you show your work. Partial credit may be given in this problem. [1 point]</div>

        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(b)</strong> The bottom of the light curve shown has a slight upwards curve, which is due to a phenomenon called limb darkening. In your own words, explain what limb darkening is and why it would cause the curved shape we observe in the image. Partial credit may be given in this problem. [2 points]</div>

        <div class="sub-question"><strong>(c)</strong> On the graph provided on the answer sheet, sketch the shape the transit light curve would have if limb darkening did not exist. Don't worry about the impact parameter of the transit, b (i.e., assume b = 0). [2 points]</div>

    <div class="answer" id="answer-30">
        <div class="answer-label">Answers:</div>
        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(a)</strong> Anywhere between 0.04 to 0.06 days is a valid answer. This can be found by measuring the length from one edge of the dip to the other.</div>

        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(b)</strong> Limb darkening is an optical effect seen in stars where the central part of the disk appears brighter than the edge, or limb. This occurs because when looking at the center of the star, we can see deeper into the star where temperatures are higher, making it appear brighter. When looking at the limb, we only see the surface layers which are cooler. This causes a bigger dip in flux when the center of the star is blocked by a planet, creating the curved shape in the transit.</div>

        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(c)</strong> The correct answer would show a rectangle, with the width equal to the existing dip and a depth equal to the maximum depth of the existing dip (flat bottom instead of curved).</div>

        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(d)</strong> Because Œ¥ = (Rp/R*)¬≤ = 0.01, Rp = 0.1 R*. The planet radius is 0.1 times the stellar radius.</div>

        <div class="answer-part"><strong>(e)</strong> Valid answers include: The orbital period (by measuring time between transits), the orbital inclination (must be close to 90¬∞ if transiting), atmospheric composition (through absorption/emission spectrum during transit), or resonant state (by measuring transit time variations over many orbits).</div>

        <div class="explanation">This transit analysis demonstrates how much information can be extracted from photometric observations of exoplanet transits, including planetary size, orbital characteristics, and even atmospheric properties.</div>
